# Simple Playstyle Enhancements

Each time trying out another modpack I ususally miss some features that I feel could be part of every game. Here is my selection (credits go to the authors of the mods, I am just presenting a configured selection):

* Area repairing
* Bigger player inventory
* Workbench range boost (requires less workbenches in larger bases)
* Mist free range increased (Mistlands)
* Automatically picking up everything (need to press "e" less often)
* Realistic discovery radius (based on weather and visibility conditions)
* Stacking and storing features
* Pulling items from all boxes around (instead of requiring to put items into inventory first)
* Instantly equip items (no need to wait)
* Increased carrying capability
* Equipment and quickslots (including keeping equipment on death) 
* Increased Kiln, Smelter, ... capacity and output speed - will increase per boss kill (new)
* Monsters drop loot instantly (no need to wait the rag doll rolling down a mountain)
* In-game clock
* Mistlands Ballista not shooting yourself
* Combat slope improved (hitting a monster does really hit them)
* No skill loss on death (did you ever reach skill level 100 without this?)
* Nature does replenish Tin and a selection of trees
* Destroy boats (and carts) with the build hammer
* Mass farming (using left-shift) 
* Show info on mouse over (e.g. contents of a chest)
* Reliable block (independent from been staggered)
* Remove smoke (better FPS) and fires stay lit
* Automatic pinning things on the map (instead of searching)
* only need to build one portal to connect to all portals via clicking on the map
* building skill that hardens buildings on improved skill level
* farming / foraging / lumberjacking / mining that makes grinding resources easier on high skill levels
* UI related tweaks -> https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/UserInterfaceTweaks/
* faster item transfer (right click, from/to inv/chest)
* ...
* what did I forget?

This selection should not change playstyle from other modpacks too much, it just takes away tedious parts and brings features the vanilla game desperately needs (opinionated, yes). I like to play the game a lot, but don't want to waste my time too much on tedious tasks.
